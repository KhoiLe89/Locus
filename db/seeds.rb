paris = Destination.create(location: "France", description: "The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance.

Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.", img_url: "http://static.travel.usnews.com/images/destinations/86/eiffel1.jpg")
