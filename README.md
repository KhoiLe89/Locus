# Locus
Locus is an app where Users can share stories to inspire the "non-traveller." Designed to revolve around User Stories, this forum type of Application allows Users to explore the amazing feats this planet has to offer based on personal, intimate recommendations.
## Installation
To install, clone down a copy from my personal GitHub account. Then run use the shortcut "Rails S".
## Usage
The application itself follows the CRUD model. Create, Read, Update and Destroy. As an experienced traveller, we mainly want to create new destinations, activities, and reviews to inspire the unexperienced traveller. As an unexperienced traveller, we would navigate through a continent, followed by destinations we are intrigued by. Upon finding a destination, users can then navigate through an activity and read through any personal reviews of other users.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request

## History
The commit history involves 12 commits.
  1. Initial Commit. Full CRUD functionality with Destinations and Activities. But as a result of adding another model, functionality was inhibited.
  2. CSS Work. This Commit was merged from a different branch, the aesthetics of the app was beginning to come together.
  3. Final Commit. All CRUD functionality was achieved.

## Technologies Used
The main technologies used were HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails along with Postgres. HTML via Embedded Ruby(ERB) was used for the content, CSS was used to style the pages, and Ruby on Rails allowed users to Create/Read/Update/Destroy.

## To Do
The app itself is fully functional but here are a few things I'd like to remedy and add:
  1. Devise
  2. Aesthetics
  3. User Authentication
