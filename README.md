# ${Locus}
Locus is an app where Users can share stories to inspire the "non-traveller." Designed to revolve around User Stories, this forum type of Application allows Users to explore the amazing feats this planet has to offer based on personal, intimate recommendations.
## Installation
To install, clone down a copy from my personal GitHub account. Then run use the shortcut "Rails S".
## Usage
The application itself follows the CRUD model. Create, Read, Update and Destroy. As an experienced traveller, we mainly want to create new destinations, activities, and reviews to inspire the unexperienced traveller. As an unexperienced traveller, we would navigate through a continent, followed by destinations we are intrigued by. Upon finding a destination, users can then navigate through an activity and read through any personal reviews of other users.
